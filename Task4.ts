/*4- Task: Create a Function to Calculate the Factorial of a Number
Breakdown:
路 Create a function that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial using a loop.
路 The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. 
//For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
路 The function should return the factorial of the input number.
路 Test the function with different numbers to make sure it is working correctly.
